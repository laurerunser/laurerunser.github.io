I'm Laure (pronounced `loor` as in `door`), a French computer science student at the Universit√© de Paris (formally Paris-Diderot University).

I'm currently in the last year of my Master's Degree, studying algorithmics, formal verification, with some data mining and machine learning optional classes.

I love reading, crafting, drawing and sports, especially badminton.

Right now, I'm working on a gemini browser written in OCaml called [mageri](https://github.com/laurerunser/mageri).
You can find other projects on my [github](https://github.com/laurerunser), or download my [CV](/cv/RUNSER_Laure_CV.pdf).

I you want to get into contact with me, my email address is `first-last@tutanota.com`.
